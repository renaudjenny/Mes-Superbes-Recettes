# Mes Superbes Recettes

**Another recipe book app. But this time, it's open source, free, no ads and no tracking!**

It's my first tryout with `CoreData` and `CloudKit`.

## Features

* ðŸ’¸ This application is available for iOS (iPhone and iPad) and MacOS for free, and without ads.

## Icons and illustrations

The logo, the background of the MacOS app, and all the card designs were made by [Mathilde Seyller](https://instagram.com/myobriel). Go follow her on Instagram!
